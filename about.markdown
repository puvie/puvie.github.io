Hi! 

My name is Đorđe (anglicized: George, hence the website domain name).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology & Food Technology. My Bachelor's thesis was titled _Bioethanol production from potatoes using immobilized yeast_.

I also hold a Master's degree in Food Engineering, with a focus on Bioprocess/Biochemical Engineering. My Master's thesis was titled _Production of bioethanol from photocatalytically processed starch material_.

My professional and academic interests lay in the applied biotechnology field, and I like to read about process optimization and downstream processing operations; I am fascinated by various filtration techniques. I also like to experiment with food in my kitchen, and read about food safety, processing, microbiology and nutrition.

I'm also self-learning programming, specifically web development with JavaScript. My interests in this field are in the so called back-end development with Node & Express.

My hobbies include going to the gym, traveling, watching movies (I'm a big cinephile), cooking, and learning German.

This blog is an aggregation of my thoughts, interests and ideas in the form of short and concise blog-style bits of text.
