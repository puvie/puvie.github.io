Hi! 

My name is Đorđe (anglicized: George, hence the website domain name).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Food Engineering & Biotechnology. My Bachelor's thesis was titled: _Bioethanol production from potatoes using immobilized yeast_.
Currently, I'm a Master's student in Food Engineering - Industrial bioprocessing module. 
My (academic) interests lay in the industrial microbiology/bioprocess engineering field, and I like to read about process optimization and downstream processing operations. I'm also self-learning some IT stuff (programming and data analysis), which I need for some future project ideas.

My hobbies include going to the gym, traveling, watching movies, and learning German.

This blog is an aggregation of my thoughts, interests and ideas in the form of short and concise blog-style bits of text.
