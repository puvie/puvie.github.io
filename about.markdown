Hi! 

My name is Đorđe (anglicized: George, hence the website domain name).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Food Engineering & Biotechnology. Currently, I'm a Master's student in Food Engineering (Food & Beverage Management and Quality Control). My (academic) interests include process optimization, food hazards and food additives. I'm also self-learning some IT stuff (programming and data analysis), which I need for some project ideas.

My hobbies include going to the gym, traveling, watching movies, and learning German.

This blog is an aggregation of my thoughts, interests and ideas in the form of short and concise blog-style bits of text.
