Hi! 

My name is Đorđe (anglicised: George, hence the website domain name).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Food Engineering & Biotechnology. Currently, I'm a Master's student in Biochemical Engineering. My (academic) interests include process optimisation, microbial fuel cells (esp. in conjunction with, or used as, biosensors), and directed evolution of enzymes. I'm also self-learning data science/engineering, as well as machine learning, which I need for some project ideas.

This blog is an aggregation of my thoughts, interests and ideas.
